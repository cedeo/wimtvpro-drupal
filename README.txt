Drupal WimTVPro module:
------------------------
Developed by WimLabs - http://www.wimlabs.com

Requires:
--------
- Drupal 7, PHP 5.3+
- php5 curl (LibCurl). Extension server php "php_curl.dll"
- verify php.ini install curl. For install "sudo apt-get install php5-curl"

PHP settings to upload video to WimTVPro: PHP assumes maximum values for file upload to a remote server, typically to avoid upload of large files by non-authorised users. For this reason such limits are typically low (a few MB), especially for video upload. The values to modify are found in file php.ini (in the relevant system configuration area of the PHP system) are:

post_max_size – Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept – http://php.net/post-max-size
upload_max_filesize – Maximum allowed size for uploaded files – http://php.net/upload-max-filesize

Overview:
--------
WimTVPro is the video module that adds several features to manage and publish video on demand, video playlists and stream live events on your website.


Features:
---------
With WimTVPro you can extend Drupal with a powerful module that allows you to organize, store, publish and stream video in posts, pages or blocks to any location within your website/blog.
Storage and bandwidth used for the video is provided by WimTV, the innovative platform for live and on demand video streaming. To use the module, you must have a Web TV account on WimTV. Registration is free of charge. You can easily sign up directly from the module.

WimTVPro allows its users to:
- connect (with your own credentials) to your account on WimTV
- upload, describe and publish new videos
- for each video published, set of access conditions (free, creative commons, pay per view)
- given a list of videos, publish those of choice on your website
- insert videos anywhere on the page
- choose the skin and the size of the video player
- choose to make videos visible to everyone or only to certain users
- create a new video playlist and insert into the pages and posts of the site
- create live streaming events to be published on the pages of your site
- recording video of live events that have been already broadcasted
- synchronize videos with your WimTV account (if you posted a video with some conditions, these are also updated on WimTV)
- control and monitor access analytics for your content

The module is integrated into the menu and is divided in sections, to always have an ordered control of content. For more details about WimTVPro's functionalities visit http://wimtvpro.tv/functionalities.html
